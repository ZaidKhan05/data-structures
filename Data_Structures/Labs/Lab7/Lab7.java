CSE1322L - Lab 7
Concept Summary:
1. Object-Oriented programming concepts
2. Interfaces
For this project you will develop a calculator that can do simple arithmetic operations such as
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
You’ll begin by creating an interface CalcOp which has 4 methods: add(), subtract(),
multiply() and divide().
Next you’ll create a Calculator class which implements the interface. This class should be
concrete, as such all methods should be concrete.
Finally you’ll write a main method which instantiates a calculator, and presents the user with
a menu. Prompt the user for 2 numbers and perform the appropriate operation based on their
choice. Continue until the user chooses to exit.
Specifications:
The CalcOp interface should include the following items:
• Four methods: add( ), subtract( ), multiply( ) and divide( )
• Each method should take in two floating point numbers and return a float.
The Calculator class should:
● Implement the methods defined in the interface.
Write a driver program which contains the following items:
● A menu with options for exiting the program, addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division.
● All Input / Output statements should be in the driver program only.
Test your program by running through all operations at least once.
