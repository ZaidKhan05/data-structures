/*

Write a complete, well documented program, that prompts the user for input and tests a recursive function. You will write a function that implements recursion and produces the following output:

//	Sample below is for input of 4:
//	Note: indentions are required for credit.

//	Expected Output

This was written by call number 1.
  This was written by call number 2.
    This was written by call number 3.
      This was written by call number 4.
      This was ALSO written by call number 4.
    This was ALSO written by call number 3.
  This was ALSO written by call number 2.
This was ALSO written by call number 1.

In this example, the recursion stopped when it reached four levels deep (because 4 was input), but your program should be capable of continuing to any specified level.
