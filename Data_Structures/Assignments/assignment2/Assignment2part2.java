psuedocode:
  recursiveCall method with 2 parameters, num and target
    if num > target
      return
    else
      print out "This was written by call number " + num + "."
      call recursiveCall(num+1, target)
      print out "This was ALSO written by call number " + num + "."
  main
    ask for input
    put input into a variable
    call recursiveCall method with 1 and the input as parameters
    
    
    1 is the first call number so that it starts, until it reaches the target that we input
